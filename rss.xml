            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Treehouse Chocolate's Four Drinking Chocolates</h1><p>Winter may be officially over in the Northern Hemisphere, but that doesn't mean hot chocolate has to disappear from people's radar until temperatures cool again. For some of us, it makes for a viable alternative to coffee in the morning-with some serious sugar and cocoa kick.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/707cfeb12d925cddf6493a0f7a931b18979b2c86.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Light Phone: Designed for Disconnecting</h1><p>Phone addiction is real-as evidenced by a quick glance down the street, in the subway, even at the dinner table-and is one of the reasons why Apple developed a watch: so we would look at our screens less and be present more. For some, however, a smartwatch isn't enough-it still leaves room for fiddling and distraction.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/83d0f5ce299ad3d7f079d449896c88dcc2ec48b8.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>eero: No More Internet Dead Zones</h1><p>Nearly all homes have a WiFi dead zone: you never get messages in the kitchen, you can't watch Netflix in the bedroom, you can't FaceTime in the backyard. This is simply because most of us have one WiFi router for our entire home, and that just doesn't work for how we use Internet today.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e75956575966b1c70c11ff614cb972cd2133a6a9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>'Bike to the Future': Design Museum Gent considers a world of two-wheeled design.</h1><p>'Bike to the Future' is the latest testament to a cycling revolution we've been witnessing since the 1960s. But the Design Museum Gent isn't interested in the past; between 25 March - 23 October it showcases a collection of contemporary models from the new millennium, including Philippe Starck's electric bike 'MASS' or Tobias Knockaert's laser-cut bicycle, and prototypes and experiments for the future, with unusual aesthetics, materials and functions.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e75dd9b06e93c20d73aed8ffe8845b13b5208794.jpg"></article>]]></description>
